        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an ooey gooey clone of everybody's favorite Cinnabon cinnamon bun. The first time I made these rolls, I thought of how much money I could save by making my own!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
            <li>2 eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/3 cup margarine, melted</1i>
            <li>4 1/2 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Icing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</li>
            <li>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.</li>
            <li>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.</li>
            <li>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.</li>
        </ol>
