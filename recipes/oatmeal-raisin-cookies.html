        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Very moist (don't cook them too long), very rich in flavor, yet somehow not too heavy. Grandma's recipe! Even people who don't like oatmeal raisin cookies do like these.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups shortening</li>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>6 cups rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 cups raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves; stir into the sugar mixture until well blended. Mix in the rolled oats alternately with the milk. Finally, stir in the raisins. Drop by heaping spoonfuls 3 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 11 minutes, or until edges are golden and tops are dry. Cool on cookie sheets for 1 minute before removing to cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
